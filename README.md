## Deployment to iOS device
It is possible to sideload this project app into your iOS device by following these instructions :

* Open the DiscoverVenue project and open the file that says “DiscoverVenue.xcworkspace“.


* Xcode will load the project for you. Click on “DiscoverVenue” in the left sidebar.

* You’ll need to change a couple of settings in order to install the app on your iPhone. First, go to “Xcode -> Preferences“, and click on the “Accounts” tab. You’ll have to add your Apple ID here. You can simply click on the plus icon in the bottom of the screen and add your Apple ID. It doesn’t need to be a developer ID, you can use your free Apple ID, as well.

* Once you have done that, you will need to change a couple of settings for the Xcode project. Firstly, change the value next to “Bundle Identifier“, and make it anything that is unique, and looks like com.xyz.DiscoverVenue. In my case, I’ve replaced “xyz” with my name.


* Next, you’ll have to add a “development team” for the project. Simply click on the drop down box next to “Development Team”, and select “Your Name (personal team)“.

* You’re all set to install Discover Venue on your iPhone. Simply connect your iPhone to your Mac. Then, go to “Product -> Destination“, and select your iPhone from the list.

* Now, click on the “Run” button in Xcode. Xcode will then begin compiling the app for your iPhone. If you get warnings (yellow triangle signs), don’t worry about them.

* Xcode will prompt you with an error saying that you need to trust the developer on the iPhone. On your iPhone, go to “Settings -> General -> Profiles and Device Management“.

* Tap on the entry under “Developer App”, and tap on “Trust”.

* You can now go to your homescreen, and look for DiscoverVenue. Tap on the app to launch it.  Allow location services. DiscoverVenue is ready to use!
